  Fiction)
description: Any writer in the UK or Ireland will tell you how prestigious the
  Booker Prize Foundation is. They assist aspiring writers and students in
  pursuing their dreams in the literary world, as well as honouring them for
  their achievements. The University of East Anglia, on the other hand, is one
  of the best universities in the UK for literature and creative writing. As a
  result, when these two facilitators meet, they work together to help
  international students reach new heights. One excellent example of this
  collaboration is the UEA Booker Prize Foundation Scholarship.
