FAQs

Why should you consider Swansea University as a place to study?
Before we get into the details of Swansea University admissions, let's have a look at some of the top reasons why Swansea University is an excellent choice for international students:

The university's two campuses, Singleton Park and Bay, are both in prime locations. The nicest feature is that both campuses are only a short distance from the ocean. Bay Campus has its own own beach, so studying and living there is like being in paradise. The beach is at a short distance from Singleton's campus. The views from Singleton's student housing's top floors are equally magnificent.

Welsh University of the Year: Over the years, the university has grown and prospered. The fact that Welsh University of the Year 2019 is celebrating its 100th anniversary is undoubtedly cause for celebration. Swansea University has been named the Welsh University for the second time in three years by the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.

Swansea University Students' Union (SUSU) is ranked as one of the top ten student unions in the United Kingdom. Each year, a full-time officer is elected, and he or she works very hard to acquire this status.

Swansea University's ranking in the rankings table reflects the quality of its world-class education. It has eight disciplines in the top ten, and another ten in the top twenty, according to the Times Good University Guide.
