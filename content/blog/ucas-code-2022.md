## What is UCAS Points?

UCAS Points are mainly those tariff points that translate your grades and qualifications into numerical terms. This means that not all educational qualifications have UCAS tariff point value but it majorly varies as per the qualification size or grade you have. These points are used by higher education institutions to evaluate whether you are eligible for particular course requirements or not. The UCAS Tariff Points are used by UK universities but those without these points can also apply as there is no compulsory requirement to have such points.
