Updates on Student Visas in the United Kingdom

Despite the ongoing pandemic, universities in the United Kingdom are accepting applications for the upcoming academic year. They are working to make policy changes that will allow students to return to face-to-face classes at their respective universities. To apply for the January 2022 intake, please click here!

Quarantining is no longer required for Indian students who are fully vaccinated. For fully vaccinated students, pre-departure tests and day 8 tests have also been eliminated. After they arrive, they must take the day 2 test.

To study at the campus physically, all Indian students planning to study in the UK must be vaccinated against COVID-19 (Covishield is the only accepted vaccine).

Until they transition to face-to-face learning, the UK government allowed students to study via distance learning with immigration permission.

International students who have completed an undergraduate or master's degree will be able to apply for a two-year post-study work visa in the UK under the new Graduate Route beginning July 1, 2021. Students with a Ph.D. will be allowed to stay for three years.

Covid-19 support services for international students have been established at UK universities, including airport pick-up, student helplines that operate 24 hours a day, and the facilitation of free counselling and mental health support services.

Make sure you have the following documents before applying:

A completed student visa application

Your authorised education provider will send you a conditional acceptance letter (CAS) and a visa letter, both of which are formal and unconditional offers of a place on a programme of study. Within six months of submitting your application, you will receive a visa letter. Applications submitted with visa letters older than six months will be rejected.

Proof of English Language Proficiency (IELTS, TOEFL, etc.)

Tests of English Proficiency

You must show proof of English language proficiency to obtain a student visa in the United Kingdom. This usually entails taking a secure English language test to show that you can communicate and correspond.

The UK Visa and Immigration Service has approved and accepted the IELTS exam (UKVI). This is true for anyone who does not come from an English-speaking country. IELTS for UKVI uses additional security procedures to verify the test taker's authenticity, while the content, structure, degree of difficulty, and score remain the same.

It depends on the type of visa you're applying for, as some will require you to take the IELTS exam:

IELTS is a requirement for certain visa types.

Tier 4 (General) student visa – for students who do not have a bachelor's degree and are taking pre-sessional courses.

Overall IELTS score of 4.0, (and in each of the four skills)

Tier 4 (General) student visas for those with a bachelor's degree or higher, as well as other UK nationals IELTS 5.5 overall for student visa (and in each of the four skills)

Permit for Biometric Residency

As part of your application, you must also obtain a biometric residency permit (BRP) from the United Kingdom. You must also schedule an appointment with the embassy for a thumb and finger scan as well as a photo scan.

What is the procedure for applying?

In order to apply for a student visa in the United Kingdom, you must complete several steps. Applications for study visas in the United Kingdom are processed within three weeks of receipt.

Determine whether you are eligible for a student visa in the first place. To begin, you must show that you have secured a spot at the school, institution, or college where you wish to study. It's known as a 'confirmation of acceptance for studies' (CAS).

Enough money to cover your course fees and living expenses in the United Kingdom (also known as "maintenance or finances").

Step 2: Gather the necessary paperwork and documents for the application. From offer letters to CAS letters to financial funds to IELTS scorecards, everything is on the table. Students may be required to submit a number of documents in support of their application.

Step 3: Download the application form from the UK government's official website and pay the application fee.

Accepted payment methods include:

I'm not sure which visa I should apply for.

To study in the United Kingdom as an adult student, you'll need a Tier 4 visa. You'll need a prospective student visa if you haven't been accepted into a school yet, and you'll need a Student Visitor visa if your stay is less than six months.

Work Permit for Indians While Studying

During the school year, Tier 4 visa holders can work 20 hours per week and full-time during vacations and semester breaks. Internships or work placements that are relevant and listed as part of a degree or programme are also acceptable.

After completing your degree, you can begin working.

You must apply for a Tier 2 visa, which is reserved for Highly Skilled Workers, if you want to work there after you finish your education. As a result, in addition to your student visa, you will not be granted a work permit. A work visa, on the other hand, must be applied for separately.

Your spouse may work in the UK if the leave is longer than 12 months. Your spouse, on the other hand, will be unable to work in the UK if your visa is for less than a year or if you are enrolled in a programme of study that does not lead to a bachelor's degree.

Bringing Family Members to Visit on a Student Visa

Under new regulations that went into effect in 2011, international students over the age of 18 who have been sponsored by a higher education institution for a term of more than one year, or foreign students who are government-supported for a course of less than six months, can bring their children or spouses to the UK.

Students under the age of 18 will not be permitted to bring spouses or children who will rely on them financially. If you are studying for a programme on a Tier 4 visa, your family members will not be able to work in the UK.

How long will you be able to stay?

How long you can stay depends on the length of your course and the studies you've already completed in the UK. If you're 18 or older and studying at a degree level, you can usually stay in the UK for up to 5 years. You can usually stay in the UK for up to two years if your qualification is less than a bachelor's degree.

Staying in the UK for a longer period of time

It's possible that you'll be able to:

You can renew your visa if you're eligible to continue your studies in the UK, for example.

You can change your visa to a Student visa if you're already in the UK.

Convert to a Graduate visa to stay in the UK for at least two years after completing your studies.

Processing Time for Visas

After being submitted, student visa applications in the United Kingdom are processed in three weeks (15 working days excluding public holidays and weekends). Students can call the application centre, which manages visa application centres for the UK Border Agency in India, at (040) 66305600 to inquire about any delays (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Applicants can also track their visa application using the SMS alert service or their online monitoring system.

What is a CAS Letter, and what does it mean?

Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) is an acronym for Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies. When a student is accepted into a programme, a CAS is issued by a UK institution. The letter is an important document that must be submitted to your country's visa office when applying for a new Tier 4 student visa. Many universities send out CAS letters after a student pays a small fee that is later deducted from their annual tuition. These charges can range from 0 to 2000 pounds!
