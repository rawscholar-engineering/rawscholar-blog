IELTS stands for International English Language Testing System.
The Overseas English Language Testing System (IELTS) is a globally standardised language assessment test used by universities to assess the language abilities of prospective international students. This exam is divided into four sections: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. After finishing the three-hour exam, students will obtain an overall score for all of their fundamental English language abilities. Exams like this are used to assess your language abilities in English-speaking countries like the United Kingdom. However, this isn't always the case. You may also study in the United Kingdom without taking the IELTS test. To understand more about it, keep reading.
