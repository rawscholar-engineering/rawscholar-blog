What is the acceptance rate of a university?

The acceptance rate of a university determines a student's chances of being accepted to that institution. It is more likely that you will be accepted into that university if it has a higher acceptance rate. Similarly, if the acceptance rate is low, the chances of success are minimal. Even if you have ample cash, keep in mind that acceptance is competitive, and you must outperform the university's expectations.
